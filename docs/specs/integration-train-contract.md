# Integration Train Contract

Status: Draft operating contract
Date: 2026-05-24
Related: `docs/organization/d2c-autonomous-worker-addendum.md`, `docs/specs/testing-invariant-matrix.md`

## Purpose

This contract defines how autonomous worker branches are integrated without contaminating the parent repo or breaking the product direction.

## Integration order

For the D2C control-plane build, integrate in this sequence unless a later ADR changes it:

1. docs/spec contracts;
2. contract/invariant test scaffolds;
3. compiled runtime model/compiler shim;
4. connector registry wrapper for current connectors;
5. run ledger writes around existing execution;
6. metric registry aliases;
7. case engine basics;
8. operator API/read-only surfaces;
9. WhatsApp projection migration;
10. controlled actions/automation.

## Branch rules

- One bounded context per branch.
- External worktrees only: `/root/orvo-agent-worktrees/<task-slug>`.
- Parent repo must be clean before and after merge.
- Do not merge two branches that edit the same central file without a sequencing note.
- Integration manager resolves conflicts, not random lane workers.

## Merge gate

Before merge:

- worker summary includes branch, commit, files, tests, product impact, platform impact, risks;
- `git diff --check` passes;
- focused tests pass;
- no secret patterns in diff;
- docs links validate if docs changed;
- reviewer approves spec compliance for non-trivial code.

After merge:

- run focused tests for affected area;
- run broader tests when code changed;
- verify parent `git status --short` is empty;
- record any deferred risk in docs/worker packet or board report.

## Conflict policy

When conflicts arise:

- preserve ADR-0005 and Phase A architecture contract unless deliberately superseded;
- preserve existing working runtime/report behavior;
- prefer additive contracts/shims over rewrites;
- if unsure, stop and write an integration note instead of guessing.

## No-go merges

Do not merge if:

- raw secrets are present;
- a new path bypasses runtime/registry/ledger/cases/audit;
- tests fail and are waived without explicit user instruction;
- a branch changes product positioning away from D2C control plane;
- LLMs become source of business truth.
